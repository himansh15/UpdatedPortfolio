        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          I am a motivated and detail-oriented software developer currently pursuing my Master of Computer Applications at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT), Bhubaneswar, with a current CGPA of 7.84. I bring a blend of academic knowledge and practical experience, having interned at HighRadius Technologies, where I utilized Salesforce CRM to enhance client data management and improve lead generation strategies.
        </p>

        <p>
          My technical expertise spans ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB, with a strong command of Java, Python, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. One of my key projects, a Personal Finance Tracker, demonstrates my ability to design and develop full-stack applications, implement secure authentication, and integrate data visualization features to enhance user experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am passionate about continuous learning, problem-solving, and delivering high-quality solutions. Open to relocation across India, I am actively seeking opportunities in software development where I can contribute meaningfully and grow professionally.
        </p>
